Notes I have written along with the code while practicing basics of machine learning with the book - [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/) by Aurélien Géron. <br> Explaination are taken from multiple sources (like webpages, forums, etc) and are not my own.
